# TheDiscover

UBC MSS Course Project -Term 4

The Discover is a global search engine that enables people to find comparisons for various products. The service is free to users and directs you to the corresponding product web site to complete the booking process.

The Discover does not sell products directly; instead, the site can be used to find the cheapest deal for a desired product after which users are automatically transferred to the supplierâ€™s website to make their order directly.
